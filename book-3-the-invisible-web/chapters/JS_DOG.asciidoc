= HTML Dog - JavaScript Beginner Tutorial

== Setup

Time to copy files again. You're going to leave the code your wrote in `index.html` for the CSS course alone, and work on a copy of it for the JavaScript course.

1. In your terminal, move to your `javascript` directory, and copy the `index.html` file into it. Again, make sure you put that dot at the end so that it is copied into the current directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/workspace/foundations/javascript
cp ../css/index.html .
----
1. Your next step is to create another file that will contain all of the JavaScript you will write for this tutorial. In the terminal, you use the `touch` command to create files. Then open this directory in Visual Studio Code. Make sure you put the dot at the end.
+
[source,bash]
----
touch main.js
code .
----
1. Now that your HTML and JavaScript files are created, you need to link them together using a `<script>` tag in your `index.html`. Open `index.html` and find the closing body tag near the bottom. It will look like this: `</body>`
+
[source,html]
----
<script src="./main.js"></script>
----


Now visit the HTML Dog https://www.htmldog.com/guides/javascript/beginner/[JavaScript Beginner Tutorial] and use your `main.js` file to write all of your JavaScript as you go through the course.
