<p>HTML was never intended to contain information about the formatting or style of a web document. However, in version 3.2 of HTML, support was added for specifying fonts, colors, borders, etc. Then, every marketing person in the world started demanding these new features on their websites.</p>

<p>It was a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS. It allows software developers to write the rules for the layout and style of a web page in a separate document, and then link (import) those styles into the HTML document.</p>
