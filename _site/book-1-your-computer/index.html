      <h1 id="book-1---your-computer">Book 1 - Your Computer</h1>

<p>In this book, you will learn fundamental skills for navigating your computer, installing software, and using the keyboard instead of the mouse/trackpad to move around.</p>

<h2 id="being-a-student-at-nashville-software-school">Being a Student at Nashville Software School</h2>

<p>The environment at Nashville Software School is likely something you have never experienced before, especially in an educational environment. You will be coached on attaining a <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Growth Mindset</a> so that you can meet all of the challenges with excitement instead of fear. You will be reading, writing, and talking about code every, single day.</p>

<p>We talk very little about theory. Just enough to support your ability to write code, and eventually do well on an interview. We spend over 90% of the time working on the practical skills of software development. You will be writing a tremendous amount of code.</p>

<p>Most of it will be bad.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s a good thing, because we <em>want you to make as many mistakes as possible</em>. The human brain learns by making mistakes and being corrected.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="/book-1-your-computer/chapters/HOW_TO_LEARN.html">Learning and Asking Questions</a> chapter to hear in more detail about what we expect from our students, and what your experience will be like.</p>
