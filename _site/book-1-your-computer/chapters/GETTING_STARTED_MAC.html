      <p><a href="https://nashville-software-school.github.io/prework/">Welcome</a> &gt; <a href="/book-1-your-computer/">Book 1 - Getting Started</a> &gt; Mac Installations</p>

<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>

<p>First, you need to install some tools that you will be using both for the Foundations Course and for your time at Nashville Software School.</p>

<p>If you have never installed software before on your Mac, once you download the installer and run it, you are usually presented with a window that asks you to click and drag the program into the Applications folder. You need to do that to ensure that it is installed correctly.</p>

<h2 id="google-chrome">Google Chrome</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html">Google Chrome</a> is the most popular browser for web developers because of the powerful tools it provides to test code, manipulate documents, and measure performance.</p>

<h2 id="visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</h2>

<p>Visual Studio Code is the editor we will all be working on to start the course. To install it, visit the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code website</a> and click the big green button that says <strong>Download for Mac</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="spectacle">Spectacle</h2>

<p>This application will allow you to use certain combinations of keys on your keyboard to move and resize applications while you are developing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.spectacleapp.com">Download and install Spectacle</a> and after it is installed, click on the link labeled <em><strong>keyboard shortcuts</strong></em> on the web site to try it out.</p>
