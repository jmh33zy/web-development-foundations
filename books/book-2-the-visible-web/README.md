# The Visible Web

In this book, you will learn some fundamental concepts and skills in building HTML and CSS to build the part of software that humans interact with on web sites.

## HTML

Your first step is to learn how to work with the language that software developers use to structure the content within web pages - HTML.

## First Assignment

> Assignment: Visit and complete the [Introduction to HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) course on Codecademy. They estimate that it will take four hours of your time to read the content, work on exercises, and complete the project(s) they assign you. We want you to start with this course because it has you coding immediately, not doing a lot of reading about theory.

The next step is to build your own web page on your computer instead of the integrated editor and browser that Codeacemy gives you. To set you up for success, follow these instructions before moving on to the assignment.

## Setup for Coding on Your Machine

1. If you did not install everything that was listed in the previous book, please go back and do that. You will need Visual Studio Code installed as your code editor.
1. Open your terminal and change your location to your home directory.
    ```sh
    cd ~
    ```
1. Make a new sub-directory named `workspace` and use `cd` to move to that directory. Try your tab completion skills with the `cd` command. Type just the first couple of letters and hit your tab key.
    ```sh
    mkdir workspace
    cd workspace
    ```
