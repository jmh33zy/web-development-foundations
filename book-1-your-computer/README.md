# Book 1 - Your Computer

In this book, you will learn fundamental skills for navigating your computer, installing software, and using the keyboard instead of the mouse/trackpad to move around.

## Being a Student at Nashville Software School

The environment at Nashville Software School is likely something you have never experienced before, especially in an educational environment. You will be coached on attaining a growth mindset so that you can meet all of the challenges with excitement instead of fear. You will be reading, writing, and talking about code every, single day.

We talk very little about theory. Just enough to support your ability to write code, and eventually do well on an interview. We spend over 90% of the time working on the practical skills of software development. You will be writing a tremendous amount of code.

Most of it will be bad.

That's a good thing, because we _want you to make as many mistakes as possible_. The human brain learns by making mistakes and being corrected.

Read the [Learning and Asking Questions](./chapters/HOW_TO_LEARN.md) chapter to hear in more detail about what we expect from our students, and what you experience will be like.
