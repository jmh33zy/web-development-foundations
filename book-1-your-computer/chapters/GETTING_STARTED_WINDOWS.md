# Getting Started

First, you need to install some tools that you will be using both for the Foundations Course and for your time at Nashville Software School.

## Install Git Bash (i.e. Terminal)

> **IMPORTANT:** For the remainder of the Foundations Course, when you see the words "terminal" or "command line", it means Git Bash for Windows users.

Visit the [Git Bash](http://www.git-scm.com/downloads) download page click the "Download for Windows" button, and once complete, install the software. This will be your default terminal which you will use to navigate your file system, and run development tools throughout the course.

### Git Bash Initialization File

Once Git Bash is installed, run it. Once it is running, type in the following command. You will learn more about this command later.

```sh
echo 'alias gs="git status"' > ~/.bashrc
```

### Google Chrome

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) is the most popular browser for web developers because of the powerful tools it provides to test code, manipulate documents, and measure performance.

### Visual Studio Code

Visit the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) website to download and install the code editor. This is the editor you will be using for the next 6 months.
