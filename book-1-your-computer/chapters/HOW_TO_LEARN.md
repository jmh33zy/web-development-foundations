# Learning to Learn

The primary skill you gain at Nashville Software School is not a mastery of writing code. Far from it. You will spend six months learning the very basics of it. The largest benefit of coming to Nashville Software School is to learn how to think like a software developer, and learn like a software developer.

If you can do those two things with eagerness and proficiency, the world is yours for the taking.

We coach you down that path, and it's a hard one. Your mind will be challenged like never before, and your brain will be completely rewired by the end of your six months.
