# Getting Started

## Google Chrome

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) is the most popular browser for web developers because of the powerful tools it provides to test code, manipulate documents, and measure performance.

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is the editor we will all be working on to start the course. To install it, visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and click the big green button that says **Download for Mac**.
