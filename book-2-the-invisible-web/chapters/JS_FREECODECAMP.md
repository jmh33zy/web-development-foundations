# Going Further With JavaScript

In this of the **Foundations Course**, you will be travelling to the freeCodeCamp website to dig into the syntax of JavaScript even more. By the end of this part, your knowledge of JavaScript should be ever so slightly higher.

You should not expect mastery. You should not even expect proficiency. This **Foundations Course** is to start the process of rewiring your brain to think like a software developer. The entire process takes a couple years, so even by the time you are done with NSS, the process is still happening.

You are on the search for knowledge of vocabulary, syntax, and a basic understanding of why software developers use the tools you are getting exposed to - nothing more.

It's a long, energy consuming process to rewire the brain. There is no way to speed it up. There are no shortcuts. You just have to put in the time and effort.

Now it is time for you to go to the freeCodeCamp [Basic JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript) course and complete it. It is a comprehensive course that covers everything that you will be using in the first 2 weeks at Nashville Software School.
