# JavaScript on Codecademy

Your next assignment is to go through the [Introduction To JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) course on Codecademy.

CAUTION: You only need to work through chapters 1-8 in the free material to be prepared for Nashville Software School. You can choose to go beyond chapter 8 if you wish, but the concepts become much more difficult after that and you will likely have diminishing returns on your time investment (and you eventually have to pay for further courses).
