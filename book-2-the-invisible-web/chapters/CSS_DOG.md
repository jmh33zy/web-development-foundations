# Adding CSS to your Web Page

In this next part of the project, you will continue to use the HTML Dog site, but now you will augment your HTML code with CSS. This will add colors, spacing, and alignment to your base HTML structure.

Visit the HTML Dog [CSS Beginner Tutorial](https://www.htmldog.com/guides/css/beginner/), and learn how to add styles and layout to your `myfirstpage.html` web page that you already created.
